###Prime Week05###

####Objects####

This week was all about JavaScript Objects.  What they are, how they're created, modified, and commonly used.

For the challenge, we were tasked with correcting a particularly messed up object.

```javascript
avengersMovie = {
    name : Avengers;
    runtime : 143 mins;
    releaseYear = 2012;
    "Director" : "Joss Whedon".
}
```

I'm honetly not entirely sure what was expected for this challenge.  I made some corrections and modifications which I hope fulfill the objective.

```javascript
var movie = {
    name: "Avengers",
    runtimeInMinutes: 143,
    releaseYear: 2012,
    director: "Joss Whedon"
};
```

There are a couple of ways to output the object, I hope that my method is sufficient.
